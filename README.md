# Hospital-Management-for-Power-BI-and-SQL

🏥 Hospital Management Report – SQL and Power BI

A complete data analysis project combining **SQL** for backend data processing and **Power BI** for dynamic dashboards. This project focuses on analyzing hospital operations including patient flow, doctor performance, treatment history, and departmental workloads.

✅ Project Overview

Hospitals require reliable reporting systems to manage patient data, monitor departmental efficiency, and support clinical decisions. This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be used together to create insightful, real-time reports for hospital management.

❓ Problem Statement

Hospital administrators often face challenges such as:
- Tracking patient admission and discharge trends
- Monitoring treatment outcomes
- Analyzing doctor workload and performance
- Managing bed occupancy and availability
- Ensuring data-driven decision-making in real time

This project solves these problems by building an integrated reporting system using structured SQL queries and Power BI dashboards.

⚙️ Requirements

- **Power BI Desktop** – For dashboard creation
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server** – To execute SQL queries
- **DBeaver / MySQL Workbench** – SQL client for writing & testing
- **Excel or CSV** – For uploading mock data
